# User Management Project

## Introduction
This demo project is for a technical test, utilizing Python/Django for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Features
- **Backend:**
    1. Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd user_management/backend`.
    2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    3. Apply database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
    4. Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`.

- **Frontend:**
    1. Navigate to the `frontend/user-search` directory: `cd user_management/frontend/user-search`.
    2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
    3. Start the React development server: `npm start`.

## Final Notes
If I had more time, the next step would be to dockerize the project. However, I choose to push it now without Docker to respect **the one-day work limit**. I'm currently in midterms week, that's why i'm pushing this code so late ðŸ˜¢. However I'll get around to dockerizing it on the weekend, let me know if that's something you'd be interested in seeing. Feel free to explore the project, I look forward to your feedback.
